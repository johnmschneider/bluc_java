/**
 * An extensive enumeration containing all of the possible types of parser nodes that can be parsed.
 *
 * This should NOT take inheritance into account. If we're in a lambda definition block,
 *  a node's NodeType should NOT be BLOCK. It should be LAMBDA_BLOCK. <br/><br/>
 * 
 * <b>Remarks:</b><br/>
 *  We're using an enumeration instead of a class hierarchy for several reasons, in order of importance:<br/>
 * <p>
 *      1) if a sub-parser wants to check if we're on a certain type of node, then we don't
 *          have to actually implement the node yet. We can just check the generic node's StmtType. <br/><br/>
 * 
 *          This will help significantly when developing large sections of the compiler at once, as
 *          now we're free to defer the implementation of said nodes into another ticket. <br/><br/>
 * 
 *      2) because we want to keep the parser as simple as possible. We don't want to have to deal with
 *          inheritance and all the complexities that come with it.
 * </p>
